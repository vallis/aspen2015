SMBH binary models: Sesana, 7 June 2015.

The models are in two directories:

1-models_for_Michele: contains circular GW driven models to investigate the variance of the signal among different MC realizations within the same model. No MBHB populations are present in this directory

2-models_for_injection: contains several subdirectory with different MBHB populations for the injection pipeline.

In the directory 'report' you find a file 'description.pdf' that explains in lenght the content of the various files and describes the properties of the MBHB populations. Please read it!!!

Cheers

Alberto
